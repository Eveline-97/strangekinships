                    <h3>Strange Kinships - First Chapter: Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        When the Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart moved to its new building, some old books were given away
                        for free. Among outdated schoolbooks, classic novels, and worn cookbooks, a heavy old volume
                        titled Treatise of the Common Pigeon caught our attention. It was accompanied by dusty audio
                        tapes and contained hundreds of pages of handwritten notes, drawings, and diagrams - created by
                        a group of researchers from the 1860s. The group called themselves Strange Kinships. As the
                        title of the book suggests, they were devoted to observing and understanding the birds we see in
                        cities every day: how they move, how they communicate, how they fly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While we don’t really know who the members of this group were, in this audio walk we would like
                        to offer insights into a fascinating document of a group of humans trying to get close to
                        another species’ internal world. As you listen to our audio walk, you’ll catch glimpses of the
                        group’s (sometimes surprising) research - while observing the pigeons around you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are four short audio tracks to listen to, each located at a different point on and around
                        Marienplatz, shown on the map we’ve provided. You can begin the walk now by starting the next
                        chapter and listen as you slowly make your way toward location 3.
